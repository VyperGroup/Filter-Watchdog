# Filter Watchdog

This will greatly benefit the exploit community for its detailed analysis and automated exploit detection, and will be a good measure to determine how much filtering extensions actually spy on you. This is basically an antivirus for filters, but also with automations for my other projects.

## What it will have

- It will be possible to host your instance either client-side only (The user must input the api keys) or on the backend with served archives. It will serve .crx and src code archives for older versions if the backend open is chosen.
- A frontend for all of the above and for more purposes.
- A public api that can return a json or CSV of the data. You may also download an unobfuscated version of the source code.
